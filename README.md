##Tech Stack Suggestions:

Frontend: React Native (for cross-platform compatibility).

Backend: Node.js with Express or Django.

Database: MongoDB (NoSQL for scalability) or PostgreSQL.

APIs: Google Maps API for location-based features.

Authentication: Firebase Auth or OAuth2 for secure login.


##Next Steps:

1. Define your target audience and key personas.


2. Create a wireframe or mockup of the app.


3. Outline a MVP (Minimum Viable Product) with core functionalities.


4. Plan a marketing strategy to engage users (social media campaigns, partnerships).

#Let’s break it down step by step:

##1. Wireframe Design

Below is an outline of the key screens with their main elements:

1. Login/Signup Screen

Options:

Google Login Button.

Mobile Number + OTP input.

Email & Password fields.


CTA: Login/Signup button.


2. Registration Screen (Post-Signup)

Fields:

Blood Group (Dropdown).

Age (Number input).

Medical History (Textarea).

Diseases (Checkboxes or Dropdown).

Pregnancy Status (For women; Dropdown or Yes/No toggle).



3. Home Screen

Sections:

Active Requests (List of high/medium/low priority requests).

Quick Actions (Raise a Request, Check Nearby Blood Banks).


Map View: Display nearby blood donors/blood banks.


4. Raise a Request Screen

Fields:

Blood Group (Dropdown).

Urgency (Priority toggle: High, Medium, Low).

Additional Notes (Textarea).

Contact Details.


CTA: Submit Request.


5. Profile Section

Details:

Name, Blood Group, Age, Location.

Past Donations & Requests.

Update Profile Button.



6. Notifications Section

List of alerts about requests raised within the user’s range.


Tools for Wireframe:

Figma (Recommended for visual wireframe).

Balsamiq (For simple sketch-style wireframes).


##2. Technical Architecture

Frontend:

Framework: React Native (for cross-platform compatibility).

Libraries:

Expo for app management.

React Navigation for screen transitions.

Axios for API calls.



Backend:

Framework: Node.js with Express (lightweight and scalable).

Database:

MongoDB: To handle user profiles, requests, and blood bank data.

Redis: For caching priority notifications and geolocation data.



APIs:

Google Maps API: For location-based donor/blood bank detection.

Firebase Cloud Messaging: For notifications.


Authentication:

OAuth2: Google Login.

Firebase Auth: Mobile OTP and Email/Password Login.


##Key Modules:

1. User Management:

Create, Read, Update user data.



2. Request Handling:

Raise, Notify, Match donor-recipient.



3. Notifications:

Priority-based notification system.



4. Geolocation:

Dynamic radius matching (30-40 km).


##3. Specific Features Breakdown

Raise a Request Logic:

1. Store all active requests in the database with priority levels.


2. When a new request is raised:

Match blood type.

Calculate distance between recipient and potential donors.

Notify matching users.




Notification Prioritization:

Use Firebase FCM for real-time push notifications.

Sort requests in the notification queue based on urgency and timestamp.


Blood Bank Directory:

API to fetch a list of blood banks (name, location, contact).

Dynamic filters: Distance, blood type availability, etc.


Would you like me to design the wireframe in a tool like Figma or further explain the technical modules?
